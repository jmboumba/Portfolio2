                    <p className="p-about">
                        I am a freelance full-stack developer. I have a strong background as a software 
                        architect and have successfully led teams as a fractional CTO. I have worked with 
                        clients from diverse industries worldwide. I have successfully delivered over 20 
                        projects for a range of clients, including solo founders, early stage startups, 
                        growing startups, digital agencies, and notable companies like Apple and Binance. 
                        I create fast, clean, and maintainable web applications, ready to scale from few 
                        users to thousands. I can help you deliver a seamless and engaging experience to 
                        your users. Background in computer science and ability as a full-stack developer 
                        (front-end and back-end) allow me to create everything from small business 
                        websites to custom web applications.
